# Hey I'm Martyn aka Kempy ðŸ‘‹, Currently a Site Reliability Engineer

# This is a User Guide

## Working Style

### What gives me energy at work: 
- The small wins by chipping away at my backlog.
- Making decisions as a team with consensus on effort/direction of tasks.
- Taking small steps to achieve the big wins! 
- Being recognised for my ideas and contributions to the Team. 
- Constructive feedback I can action, but even better is positive feedback. 
- Intertwining a passion for learning new things so I can keep growing. 
- Knowing my efforts are going towards building a better/fairer future (immensely lifting).


### What drains me at work: 
- Ambiguity, 
- Politics, 
- Repetitive information, 
- Repetitive information, 
- Repetitive information, (lol)
- Frivolous use of language to pad out presentations, 
- Not having a decent GTD system! (I am text based, works everywhere)


### How I collaborate:

- I am a deep reflector so I find that async works better than big group meetings where I can take away the problem statement to think about and then visualize how I see potential solutions taking shape and then iterating on those ideas that are accepted.

### Preferred communication style: 

- I am strongly Visual Kinetic, I prefer written or graphical comms, I don't fare well with too much auditory if I'm to capture any actions. You are best placed to get my attention if you call or IM me, I rarely check email other than for docs I am expecting. I am direct and prefer direct comms.

## Interests
