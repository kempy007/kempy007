### Hey I'm Martyn aka Kempy 👋, Aspiring Kubernetes Security Engineer & Developer, Currently a Platform Engineer & Architect with a focus on security.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning CKS and layer 8 (leadership)
- 💬 Ask me about Mentoring, I'm willing to share my experiences over the last two decades, particulary if it helps level up the playing field on diversity. <!-- (On face value I may appear in the dominant quadrant, however under the hood I come from a disadvantaged and academically dysfunctional background #selfmade). -->
- ⚡ Fun fact: I do delve into the world of Physibles, have built 3d printers, electronics, fixed cars, built pulse jets, failed at gas turbines!
